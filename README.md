# Foundation-for-Artificial-Intelligence
Topics covering basic concepts and fundamental principles in artificial intelligence (AI). It is a field of study that provides a thorough understanding of how AI is developed, works, and applied to solve various problems. It covers the core theoretical aspects, methods, and techniques on which the development of AI systems is based.

Case 1 Indonesian Currency Disbursement Calculator for Bank Cash-Out Requests

Create a simple cashier system for banks that need to disburse customers' savings in cash on demand. The system will assist the bank in calculating the number of notes and coins required, as well as ensuring that the disbursement is done within the specified maximum limit.The system should always prioritise disbursement in the largest denominations, so that the total number of notes and coins issued is less. This reduces the hassle for banks in processing many small denominations.
Simplify the disbursement process for banks and reduce the risk of errors in calculating the number of notes or coins. Provide transparency to customers on how the number of denominations is calculated and delivered.

Case 2 Analyzing Employee Retention and Performance Using HR Metrics and Analytics

HR data analytics and predictive modelling leverages several key AI foundations, namely data analytics, machine learning, and data visualisation. By utilising these AI foundations, this project seeks to improve HR's understanding of data analytics and predictive modelling, thereby aiding more strategic, data-driven decision-making in employee recruitment, retention, and performance.

The project required visualisations such as scatter plots, bar charts, pie charts and boxplots to understand correlations between variables, such as the relationship between employee performance and their manager, or the correlation between salary and job satisfaction and engagement. EDA was used to identify important variables related to employee termination, such as the reason for termination, department, gender, and position, which helped strengthen knowledge of the factors affecting employee retention.
